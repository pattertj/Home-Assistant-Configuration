# Home-Assistant-Configuration
My Home Assistant Configuration backup.

I have a lot of work to do here. A couple of things on my mind:

- Breakup the primary configuration.yaml file into smaller, more managable pieces.
- Bring in the pile of z-wave devices I own
- Setup some more automations for the aforementioned z-wave devices
